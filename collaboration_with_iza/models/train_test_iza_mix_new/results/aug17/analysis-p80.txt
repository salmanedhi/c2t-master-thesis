gold: The number of fatal injuries at the Pula Steel Factory showed a decrease over time . Its highest recorded point being in 2012 where there were 30 fatal injuries recorded . As time went on , the number dropped significantly having 13 fatal injuries recorded in 2016 .
gold_template: The templateYLabel[0] of templateYLabel[1] templateYLabel[2] at the templateTitleSubject[0] showed a templateNegativeTrend over time . Its highest recorded point being in templateXValue[0] where there were templateYValue[max] templateYLabel[1] templateYLabel[2] recorded . As time went on , the templateYLabel[0] templateNegativeTrend significantly having 13 templateYLabel[1] templateYLabel[2] recorded in templateXValue[last] .

generated_template: This chart represents the templateYLabel[0] of templateYLabel[1] templateYLabel[2] at the templateTitleSubject[0] across 5 templateXLabel[0] from templateXValue[0] - templateXValue[last] . \\n There is a downward trend in the templateYLabel[0] of fatalities , templateNegativeTrend from templateYValue[max] in templateXValue[idxmax(Y)] to templateYValue[min] in templateXValue[idxmin(Y)] .
generated: This chart represents the Number of Fatal Injuries at the Fatal Injuries Pula Steel Factory across 5 Year from 2012 - 2016 .  \\n There is a downward trend in the Number of fatalities , dropping from 30 in 2012 to 12 in 2016 .
