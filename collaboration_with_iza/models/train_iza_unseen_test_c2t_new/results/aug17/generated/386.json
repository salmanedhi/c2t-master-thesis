The fertility rate for all ethnicities in the U.S. was 1,729.5 births per 1,000 women . What is the total fertility rate ? The total fertility rate is an estimation of the number of children who would theoretically be born per 1,000 women through their childbearing years ( generally considered to be between the ages of 15 and 44 ) according to age-specific fertility rates .\n"
