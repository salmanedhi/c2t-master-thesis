Millennials and Gen-Xers were more likely to have a Netflix subscription than their older peers , which comes as no surprise given that Netflix is considered the most indispensable TV and video source among consumers aged between 16 to 34 years old . One of the most appealing aspects of Netflix for viewers is the availability of original content , which has fast become one of the keys to the company 's success .\n"
