   "gold": "No game of baseball is complete without a trip to the concessions stand , but how much money a fan needs to part with in order to get their hands on a hot dog varies widely from team to team . While a hot dog at the home games of the Baltimore Orioles would set you back just 1.5 U.S. dollars , the same snack at Citi Field during a New York Mets game would cost you 6.75 U.S. dollars . Digging deep for snacks It seems that baseball in the Big Apple does not come cheap .\n"
