The next three largest parties in terms of members were the Conservatives , the Scottish National Party and the Liberal Democrats which all had membership numbers that numbered over 100 thousand . More members but less voters While the Labour Party clearly had more party members than the Conservative Party , it has also not been in power since 2010 and has struggled to oust successive Tory governments .\n"
