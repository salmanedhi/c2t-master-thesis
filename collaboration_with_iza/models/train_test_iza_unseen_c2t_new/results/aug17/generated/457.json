   "gold": "China is by far the largest installer of wind power capacity in the world , more than doubling the second-ranked United States . As of 2018 , China had cumulatively installed over 216.87 gigawatts of wind energy , in comparison to 96.4 gigawatts of wind energy installed in the United States . Worldwide , cumulative capacity of installed wind energy reached 596.6 gigawatts in 2018 , a generous increase over the last decades .\n"
