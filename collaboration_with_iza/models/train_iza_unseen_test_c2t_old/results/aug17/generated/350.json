At the top of this ranking is Greg P. Russell , who has 16 nominations to his name , but is yet to win the coveted award . In 2019 , Diane Warren made the list after having received her tenth nomination for her song `` I 'll Fight `` from the documentary 'RBG ' _ , but failed to win an award that year .\n"
