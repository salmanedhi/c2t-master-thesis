PlayerUnknown 's Battlegrounds ( PUBG ) , which is available on console and PC , crossed the 50 million player base mark in June 2018 - an impressive figure considering it was released little over a year earlier .

One of the biggest games on Steam While it is available on both PlayStation and Xbox One , PUBG 's origins lie in PC and , more specifically , on Steam .\n"
