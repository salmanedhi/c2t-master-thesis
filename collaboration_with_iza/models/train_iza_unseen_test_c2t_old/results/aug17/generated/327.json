MoviePass is no stranger to media attention , but after the recent claims from a source that they had obtained internal data about MoviePass 's floundering subscriber base , the company is once again in the spotlight . What is MoviePass ? MoviePass is a subscription-based movie ticketing service , designed to allow subscribers to buy a select amount of movie tickets each month for a single fee .\n"
