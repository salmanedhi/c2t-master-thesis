There are three types of middle distillate fuel oils that can be used for liquid-fuel-burning equipment without any preheating , and three other types that require preheating as they contain residual fuel components . There are both federal and provincial regulations that are applicable to heating oils in Canada , including the Canadian Environmental Protection Act .\n"
