We have data recorded in minutes rather than number of uses and results are split into responses for five age range groups ; ages 15 - 24 , 25 - 34 , 35 - 44 , 45 - 54 and 55 - 64 . The scale for minutes is a little difficult to read with any accuracy due to the way it has been segmented but a rough idea of results can be found .\n"
