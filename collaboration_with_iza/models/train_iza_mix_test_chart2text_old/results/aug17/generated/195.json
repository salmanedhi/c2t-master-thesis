The New York franchise has won the World Series championships a record 27 times , with their closest rivals in terms of titles , the St. Louis Cardinals , having lifted the trophy 11 times . However , the Yankees fans have been starved of success in recent years as the team 's last World Series title came back in 2009 .\n"
